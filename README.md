# Personal-Projects
This is a collection of projects I worked on for the purpose of self-enjoyment and learning. 

## Visualization
[COVID-19 Vaccinations ](https://github.com/leolck/Personal-Projects/blob/main/COVIDAnalysis.twb) - An interactive dashboard to visualize details of number of COVID-19 vaccine shots around the world from 2021 to 2023.

[Heart Disease Analysis](https://github.com/leolck/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Heart%20Disease%20Analysis.ipynb) - Simple analysis of heart disease classification  with the goal of incorporating data cleaning, EDA, and modelling. Utilize machine learning techniques such as cross-validation and classification-based models such as KNN and Logistic Regression. Practice using various libraries such as pandas, NumPy, seaborn, scikit-learn. TODO: Complete the modelling section to use my findings for the purpose of answering questions for the dataset, compare different models and their accuracies.
