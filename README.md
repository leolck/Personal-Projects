# Personal-Projects
This is a collection of projects I worked on for the purpose of self-enjoyment and learning. 

## Data Analysis
[Heart Disease Analysis](https://github.com/leolck/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Heart%20Disease%20Analysis.ipynb) - Simple analysis of heart disease classification  with the goal of incorporating data cleaning, EDA, and modelling. Utilize machine learning techniques such as cross-validation and classification-based models such as KNN and Logistic Regression. Practice using various libraries such as pandas, NumPy, seaborn, scikit-learn. TODO: Complete the modelling section to use my findings for the purpose of answering questions for the dataset, compare different models and their accuracies.

[Yelp Restaurant Analysis](https://github.com/leolck/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Restaurant%20Profitability%20Analysis.ipynb) - Analysis of restaurant success using data collected from Yelp's API. Goal of this project is to learn how to collect my own data and work with an unclean dataset. Data is collected here through Yelp's API, cleaned up, then analyzed to explore the reasons why certain restaurants are performing well and why some are performing poorly. Libraries used: requests, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib. TODO: Sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews, further EDA, modelling.

## Visualization
[COVID-19 Vaccinations ](https://github.com/leolck/Personal-Projects/blob/main/COVIDAnalysis.twb) - An interactive dashboard to visualize details of number of COVID-19 vaccine shots around the world from 2021 to 2023.
